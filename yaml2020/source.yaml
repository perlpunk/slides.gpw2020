  [*]The following improvements have been made both for YAML.pm and YAML::XS
  [/list]

---
title: Added $LoadBlessed
content: |
  [title][/title]
  [list animation="1,greyin"]
  [*]Since YAML::XS 0.69 and YAML.pm 1.25 you can disable blessing objects
  [*]Because making objects from untrusted data can be risky (DESTROY will be called)
  [*]This allows to safely load YAML from untrusted sources
  [*]YAML::Syck has had this already for a while
  [*]Since YAML::Syck 1.32, YAML.pm 1.30 and YAML::XS 0.81 the default is 0
  [*]If you are using older versions, do this:
  [/list]
  [codebox animation="10,appear"]
  use YAML;
  $YAML::LoadBlessed = 0;

  use YAML::XS;
  $YAML::XS::LoadBlessed = 0;

  use YAML::Syck;
  $YAML::Syck::LoadBlessed = 0;
  [/codebox]
